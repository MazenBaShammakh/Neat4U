# Neat4U

Neat4U is a specialized company that provides cleaning services for its beloved customers. Services are conducted in the form that our customers want. They can specify the service type: light, medium, or heavy cleaning. They can also set the time of cleaning they need, ranging from 1 to 8 hours. Not only that, but also they can specify the exact number of cleaners they need for the service.

## Use Cases

1. Make a new appointment: a customer who wants to book a service would pick up this option. A pricing list will be displayed, where the customer can customize his/her service accordingly. The customer then is prompted to enter his/her name, phone no, email, address, date of the service, type of the service, number of cleaners and their gender, and finally the number of cleaning hours. After a successful entry, the appointment ID will be displayed for the customer.
2. Display appointment reciept: a customer who wants to view his/her reciept would pick up this option. After entering the appointment ID, the customer can view his/her personal details along with the service details.
3. Update appointment info: a customer who wants to update certain appointment info, such as service type, would pick this option. After entering the appointment ID, the customer selects what info he/she wants to update, and then updates it accordingly.
4. Cancel appointment: a customer who wants to delete a current appointment would pick this option. After entering the appointment ID, the customer's appointment will be canceled.
